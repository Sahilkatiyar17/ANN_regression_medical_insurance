# ANN_regression_medical_insurance
This project involves developing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to solve a supervised regression problem using a medical insurance dataset. The goal is to accurately predict the medical insurance charges for individuals based on several personal and lifestyle-related features.
The dataset includes variables such as:

Age

Sex

Body Mass Index (BMI)

Number of children

Smoking status

Region (one-hot encoded)

These features are used to predict the target variable:

ðŸ”¹ Medical insurance charges â€” the monetary cost billed by the insurance provider for covering an individual's healthcare expenses.

An ANN model was chosen due to its ability to capture complex nonlinear relationships between input features and the output variable. The model was trained and evaluated to minimize prediction error, and techniques like dropout regularization were applied to avoid overfitting.
